# Project Name: Mind Lounge
Project web site
You should create a public facing web site that includes all of your project assignments to date. We'll use this in final grading for the course; however, having this will also serve as documentation of all the hard work you did, and can be added to your personal portfolio. We recommend using Github Pages as a free (and pretty easy to use) web hosting service.
Your project web page should include the following:
Name of your project
Names and contact info for all team members
Links to all the files produced in your previous assignments (the final assignments are the most important, but you should plan on uploading the previous assignments as well)
A link to your final prototype and project video (it's OK to link to the video on the Google shared drive)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/qlychee/qlychee.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/qlychee/qlychee.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
